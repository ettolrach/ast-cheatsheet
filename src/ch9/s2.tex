\wde{no number, Maximal} An element $m$ of an ordered set $X$ is \textit{maximal} if there is no element $x \in X$ such that $m < x$.
\wde{no number, Greatest} A \textit{greatest} element of an ordered set $X$ is an element $g$ such that $x \leq g$ for all $x \in X$.
\wt{9.2.4 Zorn's lemma} Let $X$ be an ordered set in which every chain has an upper bound. Then $X$ contains a maximal element.
\wc{9.2.9} Let $X$ be an ordered set in which every chain has an upper bound. Let $x \in X$. Then $X$ contains a maximal element $m$ such that $m \geq x$.
\wt{9.2.11 Cardinal comparability} For all sets $X$ and $Y$, either $X \leq Y$ or $Y \leq X$.
