\wde{5.2.1 Graph} Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. The \textit{graph} of $f$ is the function $\Gamma_f = (\id_X, f) \colon X \to X \times Y$. Thus, $\Gamma_f(x) = (x, f(x))$ for all $x \in X$.
\wde{5.2.3 Functional relation} Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. A relation $R$ between $X$ and $Y$ is \textit{functional} if for all $x \in X$, $\exists! y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in_{X \times Y} R$.
\wt{5.2.4} Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. \textbf{(i)} For every function $f \colon X \to Y$, the graph $\Gamma_f$ is a functional relation between $X$ and $Y$. \textbf{(ii)} For every functional relation $R$ between $X$ and $Y$, there is a unique function $f \colon X \to Y$ such that the relations $\Gamma_f$ and $R$ are equal.
