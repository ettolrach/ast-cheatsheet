\wde{8.2.1 Map of well ordered sets} Let $V$ and $W$ be well ordered sets. A \textit{map of well ordered sets} (or just a \textit{map}) from $V$ to $W$ is an order-preserving injection whose image is downwards closed.
\wl{8.2.4} Let $f, g \colon V \to W$ be maps of well ordered sets. Then $f = g$.
\wde{8.2.5 $\preceq$} For well ordered sets $V$ and $W$, we write $V \preceq W$ if there exists a map of well ordered sets $V \to W$.
\wl{8.2.7} Let $V$ and $W$ be well ordered sets. Then $V \preceq W$ if and only if $V$ is isomorphic to a proper downset of $W$ (where a \textit{proper subset} is a subset of $X$ which is not equal to $X$).
\wc{8.2.8} Let $V$ and $W$ be well ordered sets. If $V$ is isomorphic to a proper downset of $W$ then $V \not \cong W$.
\wl{8.2.11} \textbf{(i)} $V \cong W \implies V \preceq W$; \textbf{(ii)} $(V \preceq W \text{ and } W \preceq X) \implies V \preceq X$; \textbf{(iii)} $(V \preceq W \text{ and } W \preceq V) \implies V \cong W$. 
\wl{8.2.12} For well ordered sets $V$ and $W$, either $V \preceq W$ or $W \preceq V$.
\wt{8.2.13} Let $I$ be a nonempty set and $(W_i)_{i \in I}$ a family of well ordered sets. Then there is some $i \in I$ such thtat for all $j \in I$, we have $W_i \preceq W_j$.
\wpr{8.2.16} Let $W$ be a well ordered set. Let $A$ be a subset of $W$ with the induced order. Then $A \preceq W$.
