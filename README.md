# Axiomatic Set Theory Cheatsheet

[![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/christopherwilson/cat-cheatsheet/actions/workflows/blank.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/christopherwilson/cat-cheatsheet/actions/workflows/blank.yml)

A cheatsheet for the Axiomatic Set Theory course, taught by Tom Leinster at SoM@UoE. Accurate for the course as it was in the academic year 2024/25.

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. If a thing didn't have a number, it's given labelled "n.n." for "no number".

Non-examinable content isn't included. Some theorems were also left out to keep the page count below 7. To get a maximal version, swap the commented `\include` commands.

The latest version can be found in the Releases tab or [here](https://github.com/ettolrach/ast-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/main.pdf).
